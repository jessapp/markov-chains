The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close
and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives
and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing;
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of
their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants
of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows
thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze.
The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on
his back in a flower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers.
Harry Potterâ€™s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable
by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby.
