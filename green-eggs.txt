Would you could you in a house?
Would you could you with a mouse?
Would you could you in a box?
Would you could you with a fox?
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I am?
Our failed establishment has brought us nothing but poverty at home, and disaster overseas. We are tired of economic and foreign policies that have BLED THIS COUNTRY DRY. It is time for REAL CHANGE that puts the people back in charge. This election will decide who runs this country: the Corrupt Political Class – or YOU, the American People. That’s the choice. She’s with THEM – I’m with YOU. This is our last chance.

Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. It’s just been announced that the residents of Minnesota are going to experience close to a 60% increase in premiums.
Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.
My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption – and to take our country back from the special interests.
A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Minnesota. If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States, we will make them pay a 35 percent tax. We will also unleash American energy – including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We will also cancel all harmful Obama regulations that hurt Minnesota farmers, workers and small businesses.
